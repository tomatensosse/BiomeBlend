The goal is to achieve a working and complex world generator that uses the HLSL language and the Marching Cubes algorithm with Biome mechanics for diverse terrain.

How to clone the repository

1. Clone from github to an empty folder (preferably named BiomeBlend)
2. Create an empty unity project, or use an existing project for the next step
3. Copy the the empty or old project's Library folder into BiomeBlend
4. Inside Unity Hub, select the ADD buton next to NEW and select the BiomeBlend folder.

Done.
